Python - Inheritance
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the Python programming language: superclass, baseclass, and subclasses; utilizing parent classes' attributes and methods; overwriting parent classes' methods

Description of what each file shows:
main_files ----- folder holds main programs to showcase examples of how to use functions
tests ---------- folder holds tests and edge cases checking
Files that start with:
function that returns list of attributes and methods of object
class that inherits from list and prints sorted list
function using type() - same object
function using isinstance() - same class inherited from
function using issubclass() - only subclass of
empty class BaseGeometry (so next questions can build on this one)
add area method that's empty
add integer_validator method
class Rectangle that inherits BaseGeometry; initializes private width, height
implement str to print
class Square that inherits Rectangle; initialize size and use area
implement area and print
100- class MyInt that inherits from int; inverts == and != operations
101- set attribute to object if possible
