Description of what each file shows:
main_files ----- folder holds main programs to showcase examples of how to use functions

class Student that retrieves dictionary representation of student instance
build on #11 and return dictionary of attributes asked
build on #12 and transfer all of one instances attributes to another
[Pascal's triangle] - function that returns a list of lists of ints
100- func searches for lines that contain specific str and inserts txt
